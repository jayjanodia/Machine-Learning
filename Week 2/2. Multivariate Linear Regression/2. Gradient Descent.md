Refer to [the gradient descent pdf](https://github.com/jayjanodia/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Week%202/2.%20Multivariate%20Linear%20Regression/2.%20Gradient%20Descent.pdf) for the notes

The gradient descent for Multiple Linear Regression is almost the same as that of Single Linear Regression, with the addition of the feature for each theta.
So, a dataset with 5 features will give theta_0, theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4.
