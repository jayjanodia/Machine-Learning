Refer to [the gradient descent pdf]("2. Gradient Descent.pdf") for the notes

The gradient descent for Multiple Linear Regression is almost the same as that of Single Linear Regression, with the addition of the feature for each theta.
So, a dataset with 5 features will give theta_0, theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4.
