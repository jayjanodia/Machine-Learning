Suppose you have multiple features (variables) 

n = no. of features
![x^(i)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%5E%7B%28i%29%7D) = input features/ row of i'th training example
![x^(j)](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%5E%7B%28i%29%7D_%7Bj%7D) = value of feature j in the i'th training example
m = no. of training examples

![multiple features](images/Multiple_Features.png)

So now the hypothesis function would become:

![hypothesis](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_%7B%5Ctheta%7D%28x%29%20%3D%20%5Ctheta_%7B0%7D%20&plus;%20%5Ctheta_%7B1%7Dx_%7B1%7D%20&plus;%20%5Ctheta_%7B2%7Dx_%7B2%7D%20&plus;%20..%20&plus;%20%5Ctheta_%7Bn%7Dx_%7Bn%7D)

where each x is the respective feature for each column. Here we are assuming ![x_0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_%7B0%7D) to be 1.

Since theta and x, both are **column vectors**, where x = [x0, x1, x2, ..., xn] and theta = [theta0, theta1, ... , thetan], therefore we can write the hypothesis as:

![theta transpose x](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h_%7B%5Ctheta%7D%28x%29%20%3D%20%5Ctheta%5E%7BT%7Dx)
