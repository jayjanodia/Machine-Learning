## Why machine learning? 

- We wanted to make intelligent machines. Machines that can do tasks that humans already do, like identifying faces et cetera.

## What is machine learning?

- Arthur Samuel (1959) defined it as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- Newer definition, Tom Mitchell (1998) defined it as a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if it's performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
