> You have learning algorithms in machine learning, which predict what outcome you will get based on the income. 

## Supervised Learning
- We gave the algorithm a dataset in which the "right answers" were given. 

## Regression Problem
- We are trying to predict a continuous valued output.
- Example: Predicting housing prices based on house size in square foot.

## Classification Problem
- We are trying to predict a discrete valued output.
- Example: Predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

> Usually, when you plot a graph, the independant variable is on the X-Axis, and the dependant variable is on the Y-Axis
