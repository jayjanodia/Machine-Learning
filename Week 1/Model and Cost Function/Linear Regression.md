> Linear Regression is a type of Supervised Learning
- Also called Univariate Regression since we have 1 variable.
- You are given the "right answer" for each example of the data
- Regression Problem predicts a real-valued continuous output

- We have a data set (called training set)

>m = Number of Training Examples
>x's = input variable / features
>y's = output variable / features
>(x, y) = single training example / single row
>(x(i), y(i)) = specific training example (ith training example)

> We feed a training set to a learning algorithm 
> The learning algorithm then outputs a function which by convention is denoted by h (hypothesis)
> The hypothesis takes the training set as an input and predicts the estimated value of y.
> So, h maps x to y.
> We will initially be choosing the representation of the hypothesis as h(x) = theta_0 + theta_1*x
> h(x) will representate the line drawn for predicting data on y axis from the x axis.
